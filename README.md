# Looplay

Looplay is an iOS app that lets you review your song library in a randomized order, timing each track for a customizable practice interval.


## Features

- **Randomized Review**  
  Plays each song exactly once in a one-time shuffled sequence.  
- **Custom Timers**  
  Choose from preset durations (5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 30s, 60s).  
- **Import & Export**  
  Copy your song list to/from the clipboard with simple numbered text.  
- **Persistent Storage**  
  Built on SwiftData so your library persists between launches.  
- **Dark Mode Support**  
  Automatically adapts to light and dark system appearances.
